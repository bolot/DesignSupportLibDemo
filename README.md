# Design Support Library Demo

This project demos some of the new toys in the Design Support Library.
The starting point of this project is the solution for the Criminal Intent project from the Big Nerd Ranch [Android Programming](https://training.bignerdranch.com/classes/android-bootcamp) course.
Please read the [blog post](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/becoming-material-with-android-design-support-library/) that describes the goodies.
